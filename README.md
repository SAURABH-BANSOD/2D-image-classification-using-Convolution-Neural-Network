# 2D-image-classification-using-Convolution-Neural-Network
Given image of digit, our model should able to predict the class of the digit.
Dataset: The data was taken from MNIST database. Data contains of handwritten images of digits from 0 to 9.
Class: Dataset contains of 10 classes from 0 to 9.
Objective: Given image of digit, our model should able to predict the class of the digit.
Accuracy: Convolution Neural Network (CNN) has gave accuracy of 99%.
